		<h2 id="Tab1">Mario Kart Wii</h2>
		<p class="summary">Mario Kart Wii (2008) is one of the best and, most broken Mario
		Karts ever. The physics of the game, shortcuts, ultrashortcuts, and CTGP has really
		enganced and kept this game alive for over a decade.</p>
		<p>Between the modding comunity and a very knowlegable MrBean3500vr has kept this
		game enjoyable and neverending. There will always be 1 in a million moments, and
		part of that is just the games nature and reputation.</p>

		<h2 id="Tab2">Shortcuts.</h2>
		<p class="summary">In the base game, (All 32 of nintendo's tracks) there are tons of
		involving shortcuts that take practice and skill to complete. Examples include the DKS
		double, Toad's factory lake cut, Mushroom gorges gap jump, Wii Rainbow roads Moonjump,
		and of course the Grumble volcano ultra shortcut. Each one is unique in terms of both
		inputs, and eficency. The Wii RR moonjump is just a wheelie, and a shroom boost, and
		the TF lake cut is a delay trick, hop trick, and then you snape the joystick left, and
		you get air. And the GV ultra shortcut is infamos for driving aroun a rock 3 times.
		</p>
		<p>As good as the Custom Tracks are, The Vanilla shortcuts inspiered 100's of CT creators
		(Custom Tracks) to impliment these ideas into their own tracks. As challenging, easy, and
		diverse as each and every one is, the good ones share similar track elements to those
		Nintendo Made.</p>

	<h2 id="Tab3">!FINISH ME! Movement And Controls</h2>
		<p class="summary">Without certain types of movement, precise angle measures on the controler,
		or the simple ablilty of TF physics, some chortcuts wouldn't be possible. </p>
